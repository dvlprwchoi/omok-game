## Title
- MINI OMOK

## Description
- This is a game called "MINI OMOK" for my first GA project.
Omok is a Korean game which is very similar to the Tic Tac Toe but the goal of Omok is connecting 5 stones of same color in the vertical, horizontal or diagonal direction. The oringinal Omok game is played with black and white stones on the 15 x 15 or the 19 x 19 board. This "MINI OMOK" game is a simplified version of Omok with a 5 x 5 board.
